# Horse Race Prediction Project

This project aims to build and compare machine learning models capable of predicting the results of JRA horse races.

## JRA Data

We use the dataset `data.pkl` which contains historical race data ranging from xxx to xxx, we use 3 years worth of data for training and evaluate on the last 3 months. Data format specifications and Code tables can be found in the `JV-Data490.xlsx` file.

A data entry consists of:

## Metric

We want to predict the finishing positions of each horse, and maximise the payout.

## Models

We implemented diffrent machine learning models:
- LightGBM

## Results
